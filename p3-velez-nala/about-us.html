        <h2>About NV Design Agency</h2>
        <p>I am passionate about design and communication. I worked for the Walt Disney World Resort as a graphic design specialist and I'm studying for my Masters in Mass Communication with a specialization in Digital Strategy at the University of Florida. I graduated from the College of Journalism and Communication at UF with a BS in advertising. At The Walt Disney Company, I designed multiple collateral pieces at once, ranging from guide maps for different parks to various buckslips. I worked within established style guides, while also brainstorming new design styles. I designed pieces for a variety of paper types and sizes. I have created collateral pieces for runDisney, Moonlight Magic, and other partners across the Disney Parks. At The Agency at UF I was Creative Manager and a graphic designer who worked on accounts like Orange Theory, AICPA, The Village at Gainesville, and UF SSS.</p>
